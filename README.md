## Project Description

In this project, we tested performance of Recurrent Neural Network models such as simple RNN, GRU and LSTM with different architectures. Moreover, we build a functional chatbot with our best architecture using the [conversations data](http://parl.ai/downloads/personachat/personachat.tgz). 

## Prerequisites

You should have a running installation of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [keras](https://keras.io/).
